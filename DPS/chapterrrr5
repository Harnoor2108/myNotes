# Chapter 5: File I/O - Further Details

This chapter provides a deep dive into file I/O concepts in UNIX/Linux, focusing on various system calls and their behaviors.

## 5.1 Atomicity and Race Conditions
- **Atomicity**: Ensures that a series of operations in a system call are completed fully or not at all. This is critical for operations like file creation or writing.
- **Race Conditions**: Occur when multiple processes access shared resources without proper synchronization, leading to unpredictable outcomes.

**Example**: Two processes incrementing a sequence number in a file without atomic operations can lead to inconsistencies. 

## 5.2 File Control Operations: `fcntl()`
- `fcntl()` is used to perform various operations on file descriptors.
- **Common uses**:
  - Fetching and setting file status flags.
  - Duplicating file descriptors.

**Example**: 
```c
int flags = fcntl(fd, F_GETFL); // Get the current flags
fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, flags | O_NONBLOCK); // Set the non-blocking flag
5.3 Open File Status Flags
Flags determine how files are accessed:
O_RDONLY: Read-only.
O_WRONLY: Write-only.
O_RDWR: Read and write.
O_APPEND: Append mode.
O_CREAT: Create the file if it doesn’t exist.
5.4 Relationship Between File Descriptors and Open Files
File Descriptors: Small integers representing open files.
Open File Descriptions: Contain information such as the file offset and status flags.
File i-nodes: Metadata about the file, including permissions and size.
5.5 Duplicating File Descriptors
Use dup() or dup2() to create copies of file descriptors.
The new file descriptor shares the same open file description, meaning they share the same file offset.
Example:

c
Always show details

Copy code
int newFd = dup(oldFd); // Duplicate oldFd
5.6 File I/O at a Specified Offset: pread() and pwrite()
pread(): Read from a specified offset without changing the file offset.
pwrite(): Write to a specified offset without changing the file offset.
Example:

c
Always show details

Copy code
ssize_t bytesRead = pread(fd, buffer, count, offset);
ssize_t bytesWritten = pwrite(fd, buffer, count, offset);
5.7 Scatter-Gather I/O: readv() and writev()
readv(): Read from a file into multiple buffers in one call.
writev(): Write data from multiple buffers to a file.
Example:

c
Always show details

Copy code
struct iovec iov[2];
iov[0].iov_base = buffer1;
iov[0].iov_len = len1;
iov[1].iov_base = buffer2;
iov[1].iov_len = len2;

ssize_t bytesRead = readv(fd, iov, 2);
5.8 Truncating a File: truncate() and ftruncate()
truncate(): Change the size of a file identified by its pathname.
ftruncate(): Change the size of a file identified by its file descriptor.
Example:

c
Always show details

Copy code
truncate("file.txt", newLength);
ftruncate(fd, newLength);
5.9 Nonblocking I/O
Allows I/O operations to proceed without waiting for the operation to complete.
Use the O_NONBLOCK flag to enable nonblocking mode.
5.10 I/O on Large Files
Extensions allow operations on files larger than 2GB, particularly on 32-bit systems.
Use off_t type for file offsets.
5.11 The /dev/fd Directory
Provides access to the process’s open files using their file descriptor numbers.
5.12 Creating Temporary Files
Use mkstemp() to create secure temporary files with unique names.
tmpfile(): Creates a temporary file that is automatically deleted when closed.
Example:

c
Always show details

Copy code
char template[] = "/tmp/tempfileXXXXXX";
int fd = mkstemp(template);
5.13 Summary
This chapter discussed various file I/O operations, including atomicity, file control operations, duplicating descriptors, and handling large files.
Key system calls such as fcntl(), pread(), pwrite(), truncate(), and mkstemp() were introduced.
Exercises
Atomic Append: Write a program to demonstrate the need for atomicity using the O_APPEND flag.
Duplicating Descriptors: Implement dup() and dup2() using fcntl().
File Locking: Create examples to illustrate file locking and race conditions. """
