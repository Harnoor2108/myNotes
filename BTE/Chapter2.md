# Chapter 2: Introduction to Ethics

This chapter is about ethical theories and their application in society, especially for individuals working in information-related fields. The theories provide frameworks for determining what actions are considered morally right or wrong.

## 2.1 Introduction
- **Living in Communities**: Communities bring both benefits (security, economic exchange, personal relationships) and costs (prohibited actions, obligatory actions). Communities exist because the benefits outweigh the costs.
- **Ethical Point of View**: Involves considering not just your own values (selfish viewpoint) but respecting the core values of others (ethical viewpoint).

## 2.2 Subjective Relativism
- **Definition**: Each person determines right and wrong for themselves. There is no objective truth in ethics, only subjective perspectives.
- **For Subjective Relativism**: Recognizes that well-meaning people can disagree on moral issues.
- **Against Subjective Relativism**: It blurs the line between thinking rationally and acting on feelings, making it unreliable for making moral distinctions. Not considered a workable theory.

## 2.3 Cultural Relativism
- **Definition**: Moral rules are defined by societal norms, and what is considered "right" can vary between cultures and over time.
- **For Cultural Relativism**: Different social contexts need different moral guidelines. It avoids cultural arrogance.
- **Against Cultural Relativism**: It doesn’t explain how moral rules evolve and doesn’t account for conflicts between cultures. It’s also not a workable ethical theory.

## 2.4 Divine Command Theory
- **Definition**: Morality is determined by God's will. Actions are good if they align with God's will and bad if they don’t.
- **For Divine Command Theory**: We owe obedience to an all-knowing and all-good Creator.
- **Against Divine Command Theory**: It faces challenges in a multicultural, secular society. Many modern ethical problems are not addressed in religious texts. It is based on obedience rather than reason, making it impractical for modern purposes.

## 2.5 Ethical Egoism
- **Definition**: Each person should act in their own self-interest. Morally right actions are those that maximize long-term benefit for the individual.
- **For Ethical Egoism**: It is practical and aligns with the natural inclination to prioritize oneself.
- **Against Ethical Egoism**: This theory does not respect the ethical point of view and can justify immoral behavior. People who consider others' interests tend to lead happier lives, making this a flawed theory.

## 2.6 Kantianism
- **Good Will**: The only thing good without qualification is a good will, meaning the desire to do the right thing.
- **First Formulation of the Categorical Imperative**: Act only according to rules that you would want to be universal laws. For example, breaking a promise is wrong because, if everyone did it, promises would lose their value.
- **Second Formulation of the Categorical Imperative**: Treat people as ends in themselves, never as a means to an end. Respect others' humanity and rationality.

## 2.7 Act Utilitarianism
- **Principle of Utility**: An action is right if it increases overall happiness and wrong if it decreases happiness.
- **Weighing Pleasure and Pain**: Consider intensity, duration, certainty, and other factors to evaluate the action's overall effect on happiness.
- **Case for Act Utilitarianism**: It focuses on practical, real-world consequences.
- **Case Against**: Difficulties arise in calculating all possible consequences, and it can ignore duties or moral rules.

## 2.8 Rule Utilitarianism
- **Principle of Utility Applied to Rules**: Focuses on adopting rules that will increase happiness when generally followed by everyone. For example, creating a rule that bans harmful worms (malware) benefits society, even if an anti-worm could help a few people.
- **Case for Rule Utilitarianism**: Avoids constant recalculating of consequences and focuses on general principles.
- **Case Against**: Utilitarianism can be too simplistic, focusing on measurable consequences rather than principles of justice.

## 2.9 Social Contract Theory
- **Definition**: People agree to follow certain moral rules that benefit society, enforced by government. We accept a social contract to protect our rights and ensure social cooperation.
- **Rawls’s Principles of Justice**: Justice is fairness, and inequalities must benefit the least advantaged members of society.
- **Case for Social Contract Theory**: Explains the mutual benefit of following rules and justifies government authority.
- **Case Against**: Not everyone explicitly agrees to the social contract, and it can overlook individuals unable to uphold the contract.

## 2.10 Virtue Ethics
- **Definition**: Focuses on developing good character traits (virtues) like honesty, courage, and generosity. A virtuous person will naturally make the right moral decisions.
- **Aristotle’s View on Happiness**: Happiness comes from living a life of virtue. Virtue is developed through habitual right actions.
- **Case for Virtue Ethics**: It emphasizes personal character and the role of emotions in ethical decisions.
- **Case Against**: People may disagree on what character traits are necessary for flourishing.

## 2.11 Comparing Workable Ethical Theories
Theories like Kantianism, Utilitarianism (act and rule), Social Contract Theory, and Virtue Ethics are considered workable because they provide objective moral principles developed through reasoning.

## 2.12 Morality of Breaking the Law
- **Social Contract Theory**: People generally should obey laws to maintain social order but may break laws if they conflict with a higher moral duty.
- **Kantian Perspective**: If everyone broke laws they found unjust, the legal system would collapse, contradicting the desire for justice.
- **Utilitarian Perspectives**: Rule utilitarianism would oppose lawbreaking because it undermines respect for laws, while act utilitarianism might allow it in exceptional cases where the benefits outweigh the harms.
